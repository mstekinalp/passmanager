This is not a completed project. I started this as a practice and wanted to improve little by little. 

The passwords are encrypted via rsa 2048 bit encryption. The private key is added to a file and it is also encrypted with a password. After that there is a search function(not implemented yet) to search for the added password and show it to user. 

I started with a local SQlite db but will add cloud db function too.
